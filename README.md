## How To Play

Help the bear to catch fishes by pressing the  [`Space`]  button at the right time and you will get scores for it. Scores for the fishes depend on the type and the scale of the fish. Look out for the hungry sharks.
They will be added by one as you get more scores. Try to not catch them neither feed them with the fish that is on the hook. If you catch the shark, the game is over.
Your score will be submitted to the leaderboard automatically when you refresh your maximum score.

Hint: Try to aim mouth of the fishes. Otherwise they will ignore the hook.
